            "legal_impact": "These recitals formally bind the NDA obligations to the existing employment relationship, reinforcing the employer's ability to enforce confidentiality and potentially expanding the employee\u2019s obligations under labor law."

            "additional_clause": "Remedies\n\nThe Employee acknowledges that [Abbreviation Name Party 1] considers any breach of any of the obligations in Article 2 to be a gross breach of the Employee\u2019s duty of loyalty under labour law. Accordingly, such behavior will be sanctioned and [Abbreviation Name Party 1] reserves the right that gross breaches of the obligations in Article 2 may result in dismissal without notice in accordance with the employment contract between the Parties.",
            "legal_impact": "This clause allows immediate dismissal for confidentiality breaches. It provides a strong deterrent but could pose legal risks if local labor law imposes stricter conditions for dismissal or if the 'gross breach' threshold is disputed."
